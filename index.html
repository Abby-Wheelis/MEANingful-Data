<h1>Detective Work</h1> 
    <p>
    In Chapter 6 of the truthful art, Cairo recommends that in order to examine data and extract meaning from it, a sort of graphical detective work must be done. For example, graphing the data allows for Norms and patterns in a set of data to be discovered, as well as the deviations from that pattern.

<h2>Measures of Central Data</h2>
    <p>
    One of the first steps is to calculate measures of central tendency. The first measure of central tendency is the mode, which is the most frequent value in the distribution, this can help show the most common value. Another value, the mean, is also a measure of central tendency. It is computed by adding up all of the values in the distribution, and then dividing by the number of values. The primary limitation of the mean as a measure of central tendency is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. The median, on the other hand, is the midpoint of the range of data. The median is much less sensitive to outliers, as the midpoint will remain constant even if the extremes are exaggerated. For this reason, it is often a good idea to compare the median and the mean in order to discover the existence of extreme outliers.

<h2>Visual Data</h2>
    <p>
    It is also key to look at the data graphically. There are several displays that make data easy to examine, including histograms, lollipop charts, strip plots, and violin plots. By creating a variety of these plots, it is possible to discover patterns in the data, such as clusters around a central median. Once you know what the patterns are, it becomes easier to examine outliers and investigate the reason behind them. This creates the ability to draw conclusions and learn from a set of data.
